Our commitment is to educational excellence through the sharing of best practice and continuous improvement. CPNW members meet regularly to discuss ways to improve coordination and enhance the clinical placement experience for students, healthcare partners, and education partners. Joint planning and collective problem-solving are essential to the work that we do and the trust that the members experience.
